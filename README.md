# Simple-Healthcare-Chatbot

This is a simple healthcare chatbot created and deployed by me. I downloaded the train & test datasets from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In this chatbot, the patient is asked a series of questions regarding the sypmtoms seen by him. And through this the chatbot draws a conclusion of the disease suffered by the patient.
Steps involved in this project :
1) Imported the required libraries and the datasets.
2) Analyzed the data and performed required analysis operations.
3) Mapped strings onto numbers.
4) Executed the train_test_split operation.
5) The final step implemented was model building.
