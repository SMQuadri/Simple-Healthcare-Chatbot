# Simple-Healthcare-Chatbot

This is a simple healthcare chatbot created and deployed by me. I downloaded the train & test datasets from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In this chatbot, the patient is asked a series of questions regarding the sypmtoms seen by him. And through this the chatbot draws a conclusion of the disease suffered by the patient.
